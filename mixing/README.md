# Mixing Project

This code is intended for running numerical simulations to study mixing problems. The problems are motivated by the work listed below. The code is written to perform Direct-Adjoint Looping calculations and the objective functional is based on a Sobolev-Norm with negative index (See Mathew et al 2005).

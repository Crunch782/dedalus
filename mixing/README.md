# Mixing Problems

## This Project

The purpose of this project is to study nonlinear mixing. The central question is based on the choice of the Mix-Norm used as an objective functional and how this affects the mixing of fluid in a 2D Torus. The code for performing the Direct-Adjoint Looping (DAL) calculations is written using the Dedalus library.

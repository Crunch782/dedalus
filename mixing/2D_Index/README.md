# 2D Index Project

## Instructions

There are two main files. Optimization.py runs the Direct-Adjoint process and (hopefully!) converges to a solution and writes it to a directory in the Results folder. If an index of value s=0.5 is used and a target time of T=2 is prescribed then the result of that calculation will be stored in Results/s=0.5/T=2/u0/.

In order to run the Optimization Algorithm, parameters must be set. This is done by entering the values in the command line. The file AlgParameters.txt contains a list of these parameters and their purpose.

Once a solution has reached convergence from Optimization.py, the relevant data may be generated by Diagnostics.py and is run in a similar way. The results are stored in Results/s=0.5/T=2/Plots/ (for example).
